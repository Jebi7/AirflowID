The main files are SlipstreamOptimized, which calculates the intersetions of two cylinders and allows an estimate in which regions an interaction occurs. Slipstream3 does the same for 3 cylinders. thrust_measuring_auto_z is the file to extract and analyse the measured data. angles_speed generated the configuration to test in an experiment.
